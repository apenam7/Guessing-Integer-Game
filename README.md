# Guessing-Integer-Game
At the beginning of the game, the player will first enter (1) a minimum number (a positive integer, > 0), (2) a maximum number that is greater than the minimum and less than 1,000 (ONE THOUSAND), and (3) the number of guesses that the player can have and the number should be less than 10 (&lt;10).
The
program
then
will
generate
a
random
number
between
the
minimum
and
the
maximum
(include
both
ends).
The
player
can
guess
the
number
for
several
times
(depending
on
the
above
input
in
(3)).
While
guessing
the
number,
the
game
will
give
a
hint
to
the
player
-­‐-­‐
either
the
guess
is
too
high
or
too
low.
If
the
player
can’t
guess
the
number
correctly
within
the
allowed
number
of
trials,
the
game
will
show
the
answer
and
ask
if
the
player
wants
to
play
again.
If
the
players
guess
the
number
successfully,
the
game
will
congratulate
the
player
and
ask
if
the
player
wants
to
continue.
