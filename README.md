# Guessing-Integer-Game
At the beginning of the game, the player will first enter (1) a minimum number (a positive integer, > 0), (2) a maximum number that is greater than the minimum and less than 1,000 (ONE THOUSAND), and (3) the number of guesses that the player can have and the number should be less than 10 (&lt;10).
